• Calculate when a formula One car will go out from the track. According to the speed, car, and track selected for
the modeling.
• Create a sketch of the track to represent the pathway the car will take when getting out of the track. Improving the
demonstration of the process by 70%.
• Show the total distance, downforce in newtons, lost velocity, compactest radius curvature, and maximum required
static friction coefficient.
